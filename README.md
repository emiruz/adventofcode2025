# Advent of code 2025 (Python)

I decided on Python this year with the objective of using SymPy and Z3
where possible. 

Notes:

**Day 05** -- The SymPy version is orders of magnitudes slower than my
line scan algorithm seemingly due to the slow -- or just unspecialised
-- Union implementation in SymPy.
